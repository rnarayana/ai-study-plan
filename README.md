# AI Study Plan

This repository provides a **20-week roadmap** for software architects to add **AI system design and implementation skills**. It emphasizes **durable concepts** (retrieval, evaluation, security, observability, governance) over fast-changing model internals.

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Learn how to **architect applications that integrate AI** responsibly and efficiently.
* Build **working AI features** with .NET + Azure (Python equivalents suggested).
* Develop durable skills: **RAG, evals, observability, security, MLOps**.

---

## 📅 Structure

The plan is divided into:

1. **Resources** — curated reference links ([AI\_Architect\_Resources.md](AI_Architect_Resources.md))
2. **Progress Tracker** — week-by-week deliverables ([Progress\_Tracker.md](Progress_Tracker.md))
3. **Syllabus** — ([AI\_Architect\_Syllabus.md](AI_Architect_Syllabus.md))

---

## 📘 Highlights of the 20-Week Plan

* **Weeks 0–4**: Foundations → LLM concepts, prompt engineering, .NET chatbot
* **Weeks 5–8**: Retrieval & RAG → hybrid vector search, chunking, first RAG API
* **Weeks 9–12**: Evaluation & Security → Ragas/TruLens, observability, OWASP LLM
* **Weeks 13–16**: Orchestration & Governance → multi-agent patterns, pipelines, MLOps, responsible AI
* **Weeks 17–20**: Capstone → design doc, build, hardening, launch

---

## 📦 Capstone Options

* **Enterprise RAG Service** — hybrid retrieval, evals, observability
* **Internal AI Assistant** — summarizing DevOps/Teams updates
* **Multi-Agent Planner/Worker System**
* **AI DevOps Bot** — CI/CD assistant

---

## ⏱️ Time Commitment

* 10–12 hrs/week (5–7 hrs weekdays + 4 hrs weekends)
* Deliverables are **small but production-oriented** (checklists, demos, logs)
